x-dream
=======

This is a script I wrote in 1997 for an IRC client called [XiRCON][2]. It received good amount of contribution 
from friends, notably [disq][1]. Back then it was both educational and eye-opening experience to learn 
TCL and I suggest anyone to give it a whirl.

Some of the features were:

- Auto everything (kicks, bans, greets, responses, away)
- Mass everything (kicks, ops, deops, messages etc)
- Fun stuff (random version responses, text encoders, calculator)
- A multilingual translator based on babelfish possibly not working anymore
- Misc utilities (whois query, origin country detectors etc)

notes
=====

I removed superfluous headers, personal information, references from 
the source code. 

future plans
============

Removing unneeded features and adapting the script to X-Chat could be 
a good bonus to make this usable today.
