WHAT'S THIS
~~~~~~~~~~~
Hi all.. This is the script I've written for you. (in fact, for myself
first but after heavy public demand here it's for your shameless
imagination).. 

WHAT'S SO SPECIAL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This script is neither intended to be a WAR script nor an "ultimate flexible
powerful script you've always dreamt of". It's just useful because it's
been stripped from everything useless... You might want to use this script
because:

 - it looks nice...
 - flood protection is all you need...
 - you hate other scriptz with backdoorz...
 - random version replies are C00L...
 - it's coded "cleanly" so you can extend it easily to your needs...
 - character-table translation is C00L...
 - you have no time to lose to configure scriptzzz.. :)

WHAT'S BEHIND
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I'm mostly inspired by the wonderful script Syntax... (And if you want the
BEST script, consider "syntax"... I loved it, you may too.. However it's just
too big (one 500K TCL file! :) Also, XiRCON's ass-kicking script language
TCL is the most powerful script language I've ever seen so I could manage
to code this script.

WHAT'S INSIDE?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can configure the script by issuing a /CONFIG command or editing the
included XCONFIG.TCL file with a regular text editor. (EDIT, NOTEPAD,
whatever)... NOTE: Don't fuck up the format of the file since the script
requires it to be c00l. If you configure it when running X-Dream, you
should reload it to make changes take effect.

WHAT'S LATEST
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
v1.9a:
  ! fucking "unknown command" bug fixed
  ! small fixes
  + voice command added... (auto-voice lists coming soon)
  + a few command additions...

v1.9:
  ! bugfixes mostly.. removed necessary code...
  - removed seen which fills up the registry a lot...
  + /j alias now automatically puts # if it's missing.


v1.8:
  + char table translation (basically for Turkish but easily modifiable)
  + /gain alias to re-take your nick after an unexpected hang-up
  + still got things to do... (e.g. auto-join lists... I don't need'em
    mostly so it has lower priority)
  ! bugfixes... (a script is called a script when it's full of bugs...
    if a script has no bugs (or author sayz that), it's called "crap")

v1.5,v1.6,v1.7:
  - internal releases... just for friends :)

v1.4:

  ! mostly bugfixes... code cleanup...
